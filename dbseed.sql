You and Wozia will attempt to resolve any dispute arising hereunder through face-to-face negotiation with persons fully authorized to resolve the dispute or through mediation utilizing a mediator agreed to by the parties, rather than through litigation. The existence or results of any negotiation or mediation will be treated as confidential. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party will have the right to obtain from a state or federal court in Penafiel, Porto, Portugal a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, or other equitable relief to preserve the status quo, prevent irreparable harm, avoid the expiration of any applicable limitations period, or preserve a superior position with respect to other creditors, although the merits of the underlying dispute will be resolved in accordance with this paragraph. In the event the parties are unable to resolve the dispute within 30 days of notice of the dispute to the other party, the parties shall be free to pursue all remedies available at law or in equity.</p>', 1);
